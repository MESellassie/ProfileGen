# ProfileGen
Description: A Node.js application that auto-generates a developer page based on the user's input to several prompts.

The goal of the application is to provide an easy auto-method for building out a styled profile page for numerous users based on API calls from GitHub.

Challenges/Bugs:
This current version of the app is not functional, as I cannot get the .gitignore to actually ignore the node_modules.
When attempting to commit with the node_modules folder attached, the commit fails.
I've temporarily removed the node_modules file so that I can commit the code as it currently stands.
After I've successfully commited the code, I will attempt to return the node_modules folder to this repo.
